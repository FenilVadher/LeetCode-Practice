# You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

# For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

# Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

# Example 1:

# Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
# Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
# Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
# Example 2:

# Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
# Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
# Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: list[str], heights: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        n: int = len(names)
        mapping: dict[int, str] = {}  # height -> name (heights are distinct)
        for ind in range(n):
            mapping[heights[ind]] = names[ind]

        heights.sort(reverse=True)
        for ind in range(n):
            h: int = heights[ind]
            names[ind] = mapping[h]

        return names
