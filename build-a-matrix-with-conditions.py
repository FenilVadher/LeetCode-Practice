# Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
# Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
# Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
# The row conditions are the following:
# - Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
# - Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
# The column conditions are the following:
# - Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
# - Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
# Note that there may be multiple correct answers.
# Example 2:

# Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
# Output: []
# Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
# No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.
